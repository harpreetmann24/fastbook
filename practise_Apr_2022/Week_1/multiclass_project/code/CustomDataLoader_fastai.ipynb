I want to generate javascript code based on information in my .NET application. I would like to be able to create an AST-like datastructure (using C#) and have it turned into valid javascript. I need to be able to create functions, statements, expressions etc., so I need something more than a JSON serializer - but I guess you could think of this as a (very) generalized JSON serializer.  Do such libraries exist and if so, could you recommend any?  Thank you.   "
